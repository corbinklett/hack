    Calculate distance to sound source using inverse square law, taking decibel measurements.
    
    Args:
        measured_db (float): Measured sound pressure level in dB
        reference_db (float): Reference sound pressure level in dB (default: 94.0 dB, typical calibrator level)

    Note:
        This function assumes measurements are sound pressure levels (SPL) referenced to 20 ÂµPa.
        The default reference of 94 dB is a common calibrator level.
